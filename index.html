  <h2 id="D1">London, Day 1</h2>

  <div class="writing">
    <p>We landed and threw ourselves into the Tube; we had mistakenly reserved a hotel room in London for the night when we actually had to be in Amsterdam the next day: Carolyn discovered the scheduling snafu by reviewing dates just before our trip so off we thundered, long flight notwithstanding, to get ourselves post-haste to The Netherlands.

    <p>Arrived at St. Pancras station to catch our Eurostar train where we saw the world's longest bar (Searcy's at St. Pancras station).
    
      Push the button to order food. Very civilized. Very discreet. Carolyn likes it!
            
      This made waiting for the Eurostar to Amsterdam easier to bear by far and, as you can see, galloped along at 200 mph. We had a very civilized meal at high speed: wine, cheese &hyphen; even a little caviar. And so we arrived in Amsterdam that night, having traversed 4 countries in 18 hours (UK, France, Belgium, Netherlands... at every border crossing our phone plan welcomed us by texting "Hi, it's AT&T. Great news! You have our best international package, and we're delighted at this heaven-sent opportunity to charge you way too much money!"). Hardest part: navigating a train change in Brussels where between English, French, German, and Dutch signs we found track 14B to get on the next correct rocketing train.

  <h3>Boarding The Kara</h3>

  <div class="writing">
    <p>Sunday, we walked down the dock with Beth and Paul Spangler and boarded the riverboat Royal Viking Kara, an elegant high-tech barge which is, right now as I write at 1 AM, elegantly churning its way upstream somewhere in Germany (we stop at Cologne tomorrow). Yesterday, we worked our way down to Rotterdam and into the Rhine proper, a huge river which flows with tremendous energy: we watched the Kara and all the shipping, eating caviar on the upper deck (my selfie technique never improved). The technologic advances... astonishing. The food &hyphen; I must take a much more ascetic approach to my intake. More salads, less amuse bouches or I will shortly be fat once again.

    <p>We bicycled through the windmills just off Rotterdam and gazed wistfully at the neat, ordered, clean Dutch countryside, pacifically dotted with farm and kine; we returned to eat more elegant food on board; we marveled at the gleaming architecture bordering the Rhine mile after mile and became more and more happy and satisfied &hyphen; travel is such a gift!  The Europeans, it seems to me, have created a lifestyle and infrastructure that frankly eclipse America's and it warms my heart: progress is happening. I took a picture of the Amsterdam Muzikgebouw and sent it off to Conrad with instructions to win a job there.</p>

  <div class="writing">
    <p>The first night the Kara sailed I climbed to the bow and watched the boat navigate, gleaming, down a band of dark river water, narrower than the boat is long; the dark was complete, the decks empty and silent, the earth as dark as the bounded river; I remembered a night crossing down to the Dry Tortugas on the sailboat when the wind died, the Gulf became a flat perfect mirror of stars above; sky and sea blended indistinguishably together in one still globe so seamlessly married that reality bent, and curling through the stars a band of porpoise came to investigate and then to swim on, curiosity satisfied. I sat very still and listened to the rhythm of the boat which had not even the beat of a sail to say...

    Cologne, Day 4
  </h2>

  <div class="writing">
    <p>We took an extensive bicycle tour (we became addicted to bicycle tours - you see a lot without walking your feet to the bone). The French/German/Swiss guide was professionally offended after the tour ended when no tips were forthcoming: I thought about explaining to her that we had had, literally, no time to get Euros but just nodded, smilingly, at her aggressive "was there a problem?" while I ducked back on board. Word to the wise - have some cash on hand! Both Chris and I felt bad that we couldn't tip.</p>

    I gotta say, river cruising is awesome: throw your stuff into your beautiful berth and you're set for a week while touring city after city with never a thought about where to rest your head, what tomorrow will bring or have a damn good dinner...

    Koblenz, Day 5
  </h2>

  <div class="writing">
    Koblenz is an interesting place: the confluence of two rivers, the Rhine and Moselle, bestow the blessing/curse of strategic significance on the area and thus from the Romans to WWII there have been never ending battles. Wandering about town one finds monuments galore, the most interesting of which was the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiens%C3%A4ule" target="_blank">Historiensäule</a> fountain which commemorates all of it in one swell foop. This Koblenz shop window display amused and charmed me, as did the street, along with Paul's gracing the foreground.

    Castle Alley, Day 6
  </h2>

  <div class="writing">
    <p>Upstream from Koblenz the Rhine enters a gorge which features castles surrounded by steep vineyards on every sun-exposed slope above the water: the grapes obviously love the climate there. The castles are sprinkled like broken ancient teeth on every ridge, so we sat on the deck and watched them go by: the weather was spectacular and I ate many a freshly baked oatmeal rasin cookie while gazing at either shore, wondering how cold life must have been in those forts of stone designed to extract tolls from Mideval river traffic by threat of bombardment. After due consideration, I'd have another cookie - they go well with castle gazing, I find.
    <br><br>
    The Kara docked, at the end of the day, in a gorgeous little town, Rüdesheim am Rhein where Carolyn bought a German shirt in which she delighted: we lounged in the late day heat in their Marktplatz, utterly charmed. Beth hugged a tree on the way back - it's a good old fashioned California Redwood. Turns out the Europeans are enamoured of Redwoods, and you find them all over this part of the world - it fills me with astonishment. Do they know how horrendously big these trees become? And they obviously thrive in this adopted environment... what are they going to do with a tree that grows to 150 meters?

    Heidelberg, Day 7
  </h2>

  <div class="writing">
    <p>A full week has passed on the boat, and we've gotten chummy with the captain, a huge fantastically friendly Dutchman who has sailed the Rhine for decades, captaining freighters; he showed us the bridge and talked exhaustively about the boat which is truly a technical marvel which has no rudder, just propellers! (truly blew my mind); we've made friends with the waitstaff, one of whom I actually liked, a sweet young man from Italy named David - "David!" I'd yell, when he had our table, "can you get me an avocado?" and he would always oblige, unfailingly gracious. After some questioning, in which he talked fondly about his fiancee, he was whistled back to work by his impatient head waiter. Good luck to David!
    <br><br>
    We decided we had had enough bus tours and so elected to head to the nearest train station to brave the adventure of navigating from the Rhine to Heidelberg on our own. We had lunch in the square, hiked up the 'small' hill behind the ancient schloss overlooking ye olde downtown, and then found our way back to the boat in the late afternoon which involved the party splitting up to uber back as we were running out of time to risk public transport (European Ubers are 3 man affairs - 5 of us was a no go!). On the way, in trains and buses, the folks around us were delighted to listen to our American English and offered to help - one youngster, going to medical school, told us where and when to go and on what. Helpful, but not so helpful as Das Google, which tells you EXACTLY what vehicle to board, when it's coming, and what number it is: astonishing. Google translate, Google maps, Google Google Google! Life has changed... phones! Thank God for the mobile phone!
    <br><br>
    It was on this day we discovered Paul's penchant to walk onto/into whatever conveyance or building we were exploring without paying: if caught, he was ready to play the dumb foreigner card and while I didn't get to witness this firsthand, I have no doubt that he would've put on a great exhibition. For the rest of the trip and forevermore, this is now known as 'Spangling' to those in the know (The River Rat cognoscenti).
    <br><br>
    Another happening: we were starting to get a little anxious about missing the boat, waiting for an Uber ride, and Carolyn, ever the woman of action, impatiently started to thumb a ride from a German driving a van, who looked pretty startled but whose reaction was nothing compared to Chris who yelled "What're you doing?! Are you crazy?" Ha ha - we've had many a post-Heidelberg chuckle over that one: Carolyn thumbing a ride while Chris objects.

Apparently, just before WWII, Hitler visited and admired the windows so much he decided to take them; they were later discovered in a salt mine and fully restored to a cathedral that had been truly shattered during the war.

    Sleeping at night with the gorgeous European windows open from top to bottom, slanting in, is wonderful: but why no screens? Inevitably, one wakes to the sound of a mosquito buzzing round your ears and in terror, you huddle under the soon to be too hot single-body quit on the single-body mattress on the bed frame that has square hard edges designed to do utmost damage to your naked shins in the dark of night. The Europeans may be ahead of us in some ways, but they're behind us when it comes to window screens and comfortable bedding!

We left Jonas after eating Google's lunch to wander through a market, a museum, and then accidentally into St. Paul's where we sat down for an Anglican (as it turns out) service in the apse lit by lamps which somehow make the space more solemn and majestic than it already is: they light up your personal space which accentuates your feeling of connectedness to the whole.
      
    There, in cathedral, softly lit, I had yet another seminal musical experience: the monks came out and sang; the grand organ was played; the cathedral echoed back ringing overtones; I bathed my forehead in the musically religious experience and prayed it would never end; the countertenors obliged me with yet another responsorial then atiphonal exchange anchored by basses and organ, itself a cathedral. A monk walked solemnly out and played, standing, perfectly, the organ console.
        
    St. Paul is immense. Anglicans preach primarily by chant and ritual, the specifics of sermon lost in echoing immensity and further softened by English accent: I can see why Luther and his personal approach held such sway but I, on the other hand, loved that the Anglicans left me alone with the sound and ritual to create as and when I wanted, and thus I did, in fact, have a deeply religious experience.

    <p>Only downside: I left my hat on the plane to London, and my bedside readers on my side of the bed in Zurich.
    
Maybe pick up a Peaky Blinders replacement. The readers? Have Tina give them to me on our next trip to Europe. &#128516;
