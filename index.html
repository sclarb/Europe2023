  <h2 id="D1">London, Day 1</h2>

  <div class="padding">
    <p>We landed and threw ourselves into the Tube; we had mistakenly reserved a hotel room in London for the night when we actually had to be in Amsterdam the next day: Carolyn discovered the scheduling snafu by reviewing dates just before our trip so off we thundered, long flight notwithstanding, to get ourselves post-haste to The Netherlands.
    </p>

  <div class="padding">
    <p>Arrived at St. Pancras station to catch our Eurostar train where we saw the world's longest bar (Searcy's at St. Pancras station).
    
Push the button to order food. Very civilized. Very discreet. Carolyn likes it!
      
This made waiting for the Eurostar to Amsterdam easier to bear by far and, as you can see, galloped along at 200 mph. We had a very civilized meal at high speed: wine, cheese &hyphen; even a little caviar. And so we arrived in Amsterdam that night, having traversed 4 countries in 18 hours (UK, France, Belgium, Netherlands... at every border crossing our phone plan welcomed us by texting "Hi, it's AT&T. Great news! You have our best international package, and we're delighted at this heaven-sent opportunity to charge you way too much money!"). Hardest part: navigating a train change in Brussels where between English, French, German, and Dutch signs we found track 14B to get on the next correct rocketing train.

    Amsterdam, Day 2
  </h2>

  <div class="padding">
    <p>After arriving and throwing our travel-tired arms around Beth and Paul (there's magic meeting friends in far away places) we hit the hay. Woke up to a great morning view from the hotel which looked out over the dock where our boat was moored (you can see it just past the roof edge): the night before, we didn't even bother to unpack, falling asleep as soon as our heads hit the pillows.

    Amsterdam, Day 3
  </h2>

  <h3>Boarding The Kara</h3>

  <div class="padding">
    <p>Sunday, we walked down the dock with Beth and Paul Spangler and boarded the riverboat Royal Viking Kara, an elegant high-tech barge which is, right now as I write at 1 AM, elegantly churning its way upstream somewhere in Germany (we stop at Cologne tomorrow). Yesterday, we worked our way down to Rotterdam and into the Rhine proper, a huge river which flows with tremendous energy: we watched the Kara and all the shipping, eating caviar on the upper deck (my selfie technique never improved). The technologic advances... astonishing. The food &hyphen; I must take a much more ascetic approach to my intake. More salads, less amuse bouches or I will shortly be fat once again.

  </div>

  <div class="padding">
    <p>We bicycled through the windmills just off Rotterdam and gazed wistfully at the neat, ordered, clean Dutch countryside, pacifically dotted with farm and kine; we returned to eat more elegant food on board; we marveled at the gleaming architecture bordering the Rhine mile after mile and became more and more happy and satisfied &hyphen; travel is such a gift!  The Europeans, it seems to me, have created a lifestyle and infrastructure that frankly eclipse America's and it warms my heart: progress is happening. I took a picture of the Amsterdam Muzikgebouw and sent it off to Conrad with instructions to win a job there.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="padding">
    <p>The first night the Kara sailed I climbed to the bow and watched the boat navigate, gleaming, down a band of dark river water, narrower than the boat is long; the dark was complete, the decks empty and silent, the earth as dark as the bounded river; I remembered a night crossing down to the Dry Tortugas on the sailboat when the wind died, the Gulf became a flat perfect mirror of stars above; sky and sea blended indistinguishably together in one still globe so seamlessly married that reality bent, and curling through the stars a band of porpoise came to investigate and then to swim on, curiosity satisfied. I sat very still and listened to the rhythm of the boat which had not even the beat of a sail to say...

    Cologne, Day 4
  </h2>

  <div class="picpos">
    <p>We took an extensive bicycle tour (we became addicted to bicycle tours - you see a lot without walking your feet to the bone). The French/German/Swiss guide was professionally offended after the tour ended when no tips were forthcoming: I thought about explaining to her that we had had, literally, no time to get Euros but just nodded, smilingly, at her aggressive "was there a problem?" while I ducked back on board. Word to the wise - have some cash on hand! Both Chris and I felt bad that we couldn't tip.</p>

    <br>
    After the ride we walked back over the bridge, climbed up the cathedral towers and stared off into ancient spaces, marveling at the architecture, vertigo, height, and grinned at the sight of our boat waiting for us on the other side of the Rhine.
    <br>
    <br>
    I gotta say, river cruising is awesome: throw your stuff into your beautiful berth and you're set for a week while touring city after city with never a thought about where to rest your head or have a damn good dinner...

  <h2 id="D5">
    Koblenz, Day 5
  </h2>

  <div class="picpos">
    <br>
    Koblenz is an interesting place: the confluence of two rivers, the Rhine and Moselle, bestow the blessing/curse of strategic significance on the area and thus from the Romans to WWII there have been never ending battles. Wandering about town one finds monuments galore, the most interesting of which was the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiens%C3%A4ule" target="_blank">Historiensäule</a> fountain which commemorates all of it in one swell foop. This Koblenz shop window display amused and charmed me, as did the street, along with Paul's gracing the foreground.

  <div class="padding">
    <p>Strasbourg was never a city I would have thought of but old town is absolutely charming, with a capital C. We wandered here and there, ate lunch, bought shoes, had a cafe... </p>

    <p>Not sure what the girls thought they were going to see, but there you have it. <br><br>We swung into the Cathedral, like we did in every town (it's an American affliction) - Strasbourg's is magnificent. Apparently, just before WWII, Hitler visited and admired the windows so much he decided to take them; they were later discovered in a salt mine and fully restored to a cathedral that had been truly shattered during the war. So there's something the little basket did that was actually of service!</p>

    <p>If I had only heard these guys when I was young and impressionable, I would've played Smetana with some real verve! I understand where Liszt Ferenc (last name first in Hungary) is coming from, not to mention Chopin Frederic... I wonder if my latest favorite pianist, <a href="https://youtu.be/KsGLmrR0BVs?si=Gv-h5Ft64NfUEe3N" target="_blank">Yunchan Lim</a>, has heard this? Look at the "piano" - it's a dulcimer complete with a square piano steel frame, piano strings, pedals, but no keyboard: you play it with mallets. Wild! I loved it.

    Porto Valtravaglia, Day 17
  </h2>

  <div class="padding">
    <p>We walked up to the top of a little hill and saw the goal: lunch in a piazza (Castelvecana, if you please). This turned out to be a bit of a "death march" (quoting Stewart!) experience as we had to slide down the hill to get there.

Sleeping at night with the gorgeous European windows open from top to bottom, slanting in, is wonderful: but why no screens? Inevitably, one wakes to the sound of a mosquito buzzing round your ears and in terror, you huddle under the soon to be too hot single-body quit on the single-body mattress on the bed frame that has square hard edges designed to do utmost damage to your naked shins in the dark of night. The Europeans may be ahead of us in some ways, but they're behind us when it comes to window screens and comfortable bedding!

  <h2 id="D28">London, Day 28</h2>

  <div class="padding">
    <p>This was, quite simply, an epic day amongst epic days. Maybe, because I'm older and greyer and have survived the frailties of my flesh I appreciate more, but there you have it: I do. Met Jonas at his work and almost cried, blubbering, while giving him a hello hug: glad to see him doing obviously well, working at a big company to nurture a family all his own. We left Jonas after eating Google's lunch to wander through a market, a museum, and then accidentally into St. Paul's where we sat down for an Anglican (as it turns out) service in the apse lit by lamps which somehow make the space more solemn and majestic than it already is: they light up your personal space which accentuates your feeling of connectedness to the whole.
      
There, in cathedral, softly lit, I had yet another seminal musical experience: the monks came out and sang; the grand organ was played; the cathedral echoed back ringing overtones; I bathed my forehead in the musically religious experience and prayed it would never end; the countertenors obliged me with yet another responsorial then atiphonal exchange anchored by basses and organ, itself a cathedral. A monk walked solemnly out and played, standing, perfectly, the organ console.
    
St. Paul is immense. Anglicans preach primarily by chant and ritual, the specifics of sermon lost in echoing immensity and further softened by English accent: I can see why Luther and his personal approach held such sway but I, on the other hand, loved that the Anglicans left me alone with the sound and ritual to create as and when I wanted, and thus I did, in fact, have a deeply religious experience.
